# DCGAN: Generating Fake Faces using Pytorch

Hi, this repo aims to generate fake faces using the Celeb-A Faces dataset and Pytorch.

My little project references primarily from a Pytorch tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html.

I rewrote the code line by line, but you can see that some of the codes and comments are different. Besides, I added a huge number of comments to explain in details the tutorial and express my opinions as well.

So...you may consider question me about things on the code or relevant topics if that bothers you :D
